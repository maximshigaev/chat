# Chat
This repository contains the chat application.

## Usage
First of all, clone or download this repository on the local machine. After that, open the terminal in your code editor and run `npm i`. This command will install all necessary dependencies via NPM. In order to create an optimized production build run `npm run build` command. In order to open this project in the browser firstly run `npm run json:server` command that will launch the server and generate necessary data and secondly run `npm start` command that will create the development build.

## Requirements specification
Within this project should be implemented features listed below:

### Technologies and libraries
- React
- Create-react-app
- Es6+
- Scss
- React-router
- Axios
- Json-server

### App should consist of three layers
- User interface layer

To implement chat (navigation and rooms panel on the left side, chat at the center, user's profile on the right side). To add routing for switching between the channels using react-router.
- Store layer

To add a separate layer of the store for the data storage (at this stage it is possible to keep data in constants). Data for the User interface should be taken from the store and passed through to the components.
- Api layer

To add the Api layer using Axios Ð¸ Json-server.

### Limitations
- Navigation and rooms panel, chat and user's profile components should be split into the separate components

## Personal goals
- To train the skill of building responsive web application via React and Scss from scratch
- To use the Mobx library as a state-manager and to add reactivity to the project
- To use the Json-server library for the server-side Api and to build the right data-model

## Technical stack
- React v.16.13.1
- Mobx v.5.15.4
- Create-react-app
- Es6+
- Scss
- React-router
- Axios
- Json-server
- Faker
- Formik
- Yup

## The description of the project

### Authorization
First of all, the user, that runs the application will see the spinner, which indicates the loading process. After its completion, if the user has been already authorized to the chat, he will be immediately redirected to the Main-page. Otherwise, he will be immediately redirected to the Login-page. The Login-page has a form that built using the Formik library. It, in turn, consists of two fields:
- Email (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long, should be a valid email address)
- Password (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)

The form also has two buttons:
- Login-button (will be disabled until all fields will be considered valid)
- Signup-button

After the user clicks on the Login-button or press enter when the cursor is within one of the fields, the checking process is triggered. It defines whether the user with given email has been already registered as a member of the chat and if the user wasn't found, the form displays the corresponding error message. In this case, the new user will be prompted to go to the Signup-page for the registration by pressing the Signup-button. If the user was recognized as a member of the chat, he will be redirected to the Main-page. During the login process, he will see the spinner. If there was an error during it, the user will see the backup interface with the information about this.

### Registration
User can reach the Signup-page either via direct input of its URL or via pressing the Signup-button on the Login-page. If the user has been already authorized to the chat, he will be immediately redirected to the Main-page. If the user wants to come back to the Login-page, he can make it by pressing the link to the Login-page at the top-right corner. Signup-page has form that built using the Formik library. It consists of six fields:
- Firstname (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)
- Surname (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)
- Username (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)
- Email (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long, should be a valid email address)
- Password (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)
- Skype (required for the successful login, validated using the Yup library - shouldn't be too short and too long)

The form also has Signup-button. Signup-button will be disabled until all fields will be considered valid. After the user clicks on the button or press enter when the cursor is within one of the fields, the checking process is triggered. It defines whether the user with the given username and email has been already registered as a member of the chat and if so, the form displays the corresponding error message. If the user was recognized as a new user of the chat, he will be redirected to the Main-page. During the signup process, he will see the spinner. If there was an error during it, the user will see the backup interface with the information about this.

### Main functionality

#### Server-side Api
The Server-side Api of the chat was built using the Json-server library. It consists of three main entities: 
- users (were formed using the Faker library and represents random values)
- messages (were formed using the Faker library and represents random values)
- channels (were formed using the Faker library and represents random values)

#### Client-side Api
Client-side Api of the chat was built using the Axios library. It has Axios config and implement some methods for making GET, POST, PUT and DELETE http-requests to the server.

#### Store 
The store of the chat was built using the Mobx state-manager. It implements all logic of the app that needs to be performed during the usage over time. This logic includes:
- observable values
- computed values
- some methods (actions) intended to operate with these values or to implement other logic

#### User interface
User interface of the app consists of the three main parts:
